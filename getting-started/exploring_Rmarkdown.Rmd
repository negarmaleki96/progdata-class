```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
mtcars_tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model")

mtcars
mtcars_tbl
knitr::kable(mtcars_tbl)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
