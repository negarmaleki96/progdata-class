# 1-1

# 1-2

# 1-3
# The color aesthetic typically changes the outside outline of an object and 
# the fill aesthetic is typically the inside shading. However, if we put alpha 
# in aes(), it does not apply the alpha to the legend, so the result doesn't
# looks good.(we put alpha in the geom to apply it to all attributes of the 
# previous layer)
