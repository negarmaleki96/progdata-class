This is an R Shiny App which shows laptop brands against different features each contains. This Shiny app has two tabs. The first tab gives an Introduction. In the second tab, I used Laptop Specs and latest price data from Kaggle in order to explore different brands in their operating systems.

The scatter plot may not make sense for all the features, but I put all the features in the slider, because I think having the collection of features is interesting.
