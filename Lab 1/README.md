My name is *Negar*, and I am a Ph.D. student in **the Big Data Analytics** program. I am so excited to learn many new things, mostly when big data shows up! Python is my favorite programming language, but I can't wait to see whether this course will change my interest. Let's see which programming language will win the battle!!!
